# Complex Conditions Practice Questions

## Hard

### 1. Check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5, but not by 7.
- **Task:** Use multiple `&&` and `||` operators.
- **Hint:** Combine conditions with `&&` and `||` to exclude 7.

### 2. Write a script to verify if a given time (hours and minutes) is within office hours (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM).
- **Task:** Use `&&` to check both hours and minutes.
- **Hint:** Include edge cases for 9:00 and 6:00.

### 3. Write a script to check if a triangle is valid given its three angles.
- **Task:** Ensure the sum of angles is 180 and all angles are greater than 0.
- **Hint:** Use `&&` and `===` together.

### 4. Write a script to determine if a person is eligible for a discount based on multiple conditions (age, membership status, and purchase amount).
- **Task:** Combine multiple conditions with `&&` and `||`.

### 5. Write a script to check if a given year is a leap year based on complex conditions.
- **Task:** Use `if` with `&&` and `||`.
- **Hint:** Leap year rules involve divisibility by 4 and exceptions for 100 and 400.

### 6. Write a script to validate login based on username and password rules (e.g., admin users must use specific password patterns).
- **Task:** Combine string comparison with multiple `&&`.
- **Hint:** Use logical operators to enforce rules like "admin" users have stricter requirements.

### 7. Write a script to check if a given point (x, y) lies in a specific region of a Cartesian plane.
- **Task:** Define the region using multiple conditions.
- **Hint:** Example region: `x > 0 && y > 0 || x < -10 && y < -10`.

### 8. Write a script to evaluate if a student passes or fails a course based on marks in multiple subjects with specific weightage.
- **Task:** Combine weighted averages and conditions.
- **Hint:** Example: 40% minimum in all subjects and 50% overall average.

### 9. Write a script to classify a personâ€™s BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese) based on BMI value and other health metrics (e.g., age, height).
- **Task:** Combine ranges and multiple logical operators.
- **Hint:** Use conditions like "BMI > 25 && age > 40".

### 10. Write a script to determine if a password is valid based on complex criteria (e.g., contains uppercase, lowercase, number, special character, and no spaces).
- **Task:** Combine regular expressions with `&&`.
- **Hint:** Use regex for character matching and string conditions to check for spaces.
